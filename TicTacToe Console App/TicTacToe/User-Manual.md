# User Manual

Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! In this game, you and your opponent will take turns placing your chosen symbol (either an "X" or an "O") on a 3x3 grid in the terminal. The first player to place three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## Getting Started

To start the game, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Tic Tac Toe game on your computer.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you installed the game.

3. Run the game by executing the `TicTacToe` binary file:

```
./TicTacToe
```

## Playing the game

Once the game has started, you will be presented with the game board in the terminal. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid, with each tile numbered from 1 to 9.

To place your symbol on the game board, select the tile where you want to place it by entering the tile number on the keyboard and pressing Enter. Your symbol will be placed on the selected tile, and it will be your opponent's turn to make a move.

The game continues in this way, with each player taking turns to place their symbol on the game board, until one of the following conditions is met:

- One of the players successfully places three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. In this case, the game ends and that player wins.
- All of the tiles on the game board are occupied without any player achieving three in a row. In this case, the game ends in a draw.
